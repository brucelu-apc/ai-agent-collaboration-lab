# AI Agent & Human Collaboration Lab 👨‍💻🤝🤖

This repository serves as a demonstration and playground for **Human-AI Partnership** and **Multi-Agent Orchestration** within the OpenClaw ecosystem.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Human-AI Synergy**: Showcase how 米爸 and AI agents (Dango series) collaborate on complex tasks.
- **Task Delegation**: Demonstrate effective handoffs between human intent and agent execution.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Use multiple specialized agents to support human-led projects.
- **Infrastructure**: Explore cross-node communication via Tailscale to enable collaboration anywhere.

## 🏗 Project Structure
- `/patterns`: Documentation of Human-AI collaboration workflows (e.g., Pilot/Co-pilot, Reviewer/Creator).
- `/demos`: Step-by-step collaboration scenarios.
- `/scripts`: Automation scripts for setting up collaborative environments.

## 🚀 Collaboration Patterns
1. **Interactive Refinement**: Human provides a vision, Agent drafts, and they iterate together.
2. **Execution Handoff**: Human defines the SPEC, Agent builds, Human verifies.
3. **Multi-Node Support**: Human interacts with a central "Brain" (Gateway) that orchestrates nodes (Dango 1 & 2) for heavy lifting.
