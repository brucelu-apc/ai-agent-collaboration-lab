# AI Agent Collaboration Lab 🤖🤝🤖

This repository serves as a demonstration and playground for **Multi-Agent Orchestration** and **Collaborative Workflows** using AI agents (specifically within the OpenClaw ecosystem).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate how multiple agents (e.g., Dango No. 1, 2, and 3) can share tasks.
- Explore cross-node communication via Tailscale.
- Prototype "Agent-to-Agent" handoffs and supervision.

## 🏗 Project Structure
- `/demos`: Step-by-step collaboration scenarios.
- `/protocols`: Documentation on how agents talk to each other.
- `/scripts`: Automation scripts for multi-agent setups.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Pairing**: Connect nodes using `openclaw nodes`.
2. **Task Handoff**: Use `sessions_spawn` to delegate work to specialized agents.
3. **Shared Memory**: Utilize workspace files to maintain context across turns.
